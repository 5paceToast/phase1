Abyss OS "official" packages
======

To contribute:
1. If you haven't contributed before, add yourself to the list of AUTHORS.
  This should be done with a separate commit, the title being `AUTHORS: add [name]`.
2. Create a commit (one per package). The commit message should be `<path>: action`.
  For example, `core/zsh: upgrade to <version>`.
